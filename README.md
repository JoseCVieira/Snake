# Snake
Implementation of Snake in a simple program c++.

### Description:
###### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms. After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest in the snake concept as it found a larger audience.

### Gameplay:
In this particular case, the controls are the typical WASD controls. Below, you can see some screenshot of this game:
